Hi and welcome to my collections of thoughts and collected nuggets of information.

I create notes using [Obsidian.md](https://www.obsidian.md), which are then are processed by [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) to convert these notes into what you see now.

## The rabbit hole
This collection of thoughts are written attempting to follow the idea of ][Atomic Notes](notes/Atomic%20Note.md) so that each note is intended to be as small and concise as possible.

I create bigger contexts for my notes by collecting them in special notes that acts like maps for the various contexts. This opens up the possibility for me to reuse a note in multiple contexts, without having to rewrite the information. 

I also create context for each individual note by attempting to link them to other notes that are relevant to the note, and this is where this system really starts shines for me. 
It is through this particular aspect that any individual idea could possibly lead to entirely new insights when I find two topics I otherwise never would have thought of being related to each other.
