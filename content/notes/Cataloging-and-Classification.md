# Cataloging & Classification
- Tagging is very useful, but the lack of control and meaning breaks things down fast
- A controlled term is worth a thousand tags
- _Classification_ is **where things go**; either on a shelf or in a computer system and so on
- _Cataloging_ is **what we call things**; the subject headings, aliases or tags
