The **Leitner System** is a methodology for [Spaced repetition](notes/Spaced-repetition.md)

- Flashcards are sorted into groups according to how well the learner knows each one in the *Leitner's learning box(es)*
- The student try to recall the solution written on a flashcard
  - If they succeed, they send the card to the next group
  - If they fail, they send it back to the first group
    - An alternative is to only move the card into the box in the preceeding level (i.e a box that will be review more often than the one it just came from) instead of the first box
- Each succeeding group has a longer period of time before the learner is required to revisit the cards. 
  - In Leitner's original method, published in his book _So lernt man Lernen_ (How to learn to learn), the schedule of repetition was governed by the size of the partitions in the learning box. 
    - These were 1, 2, 5, 8 and 14cm. 
  - Only when a partition became full was the learner to review some of the cards it contained
    - if they remembered it correctly, the card will be moved into a box for later review
    - if they **did not** remember it correctly, the card would be moved into the box for daily reviews
  
## Intervals
So each box has a defined interval of time for when the student will review them.
The amount of time is not fixed, but here are some guidelines:

- Box 1 is for daily reviews
- Box 2 would be for slightly longer intervals (2 to 5 days for example) 
- Box 3 would then be for even longer intervals (6 to 14 days for example)
 
 If you use more than 3 boxes, each new box would be a larger increment of time than the previous ones.
