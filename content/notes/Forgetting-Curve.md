The "Forgetting Curve" is a theory by **Hermann Ebbinghaus** produced during his studies on our ability to learn.
Here is a simple explanation of his findings:
- He first repeatedly read a random list of 3 letter symbols (for example ABC, BAC and so on) until he could recite them correctly (with no mistakes)
  - 20 minutes later, he could correctly recite about 55% of the list
  - 40 minutes after that, he could correctly recite about 45%
  - After 9 hours, it was down to 40%
  - After 24 hours, it was closer to 35%
  - And after 48 hours, it was closer to 30%

See figure below for a graphical representation of how much he could remember correctly

> **Hermann Ebbinghaus** chose to use lists of three random letter symbols as these would not be as easy to remember as actual words.

> This is an important detail as it is easier to remember things that we can associate with existing knowledge, therefore such things would skew the results.

> An important note is that the amount of details we forget will vary based on many circumstance, so these numbers are *NOT* an universal truth for all studies

> But by monitoring how much a student forgets, based on things such as topic, time of day, day of the week, how long the student has been studying
> we might be able to identify a pattern for the unique student and thereby adapting the ***Spaced Repetition*** intervals to better suit their unique needs
