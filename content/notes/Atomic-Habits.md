- The most common cues, time and location, will help you achieve your goals
  - So plan what to do, when to do it and where to do it
    - "I will **[behaviour] **at **[time]** in **[this location]**"
- **Habit Stacking**
  - Perform your new habit after an existing habit
    - "I will **meditate for 10 minutes** *after dinner*"
    - A chain of habits is more likely to be sustained if you practice consistently
    - Choosing the correct cue is the most vital part of this technique
      - **You need *a cue that will not fail*, in other words something that happens every day**
        - Such as waking up, eating, going to bed etc.
- >"Motivation is highly overrated, you can better shape your behaviour by designing your environment"
  - *Don't rely on motivation/willpower to perform tasks*
    - **Adapt your environment to *enable* your desired habit**
      - And conversely, **adapt your environment to *disable* unwanted habits**
- >"One space, one use"
  - Where we do what in our own home matters
    - If we relax in the sofa, doing tasks that require focus will become unnecessarily hard
- *When we expect to be rewarded*, **we take action**
  - **The more rewarding, the more likely we're to repeat it**
  - Rewards trigger dopamine-production and it's the reason humans are more likely to repeat rewarding actions
  - Often the thought of something (_a craving_) **causes a bigger dopamine release than the reward from actually having done it**
    - The **craving** is what causes us to *take action*
  - Making a habit attractive is vital, because **it is the expectation of a rewarding experience that drives us to act**
- **Temptation bundling** is the act of combining the action of something we need to with one we want to do
  - Example: *watching Netflix (want to do)* **while working out (need to do)**
    - [[Premack's principle]]

# Quote

> *Future You* is unreliable and cannot be counted on to be responsible. Never delegate important tasks to them. They're much more likely to do something completely else than *Today You* are.
