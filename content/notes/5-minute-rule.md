> "Promise yourself to do only 5 minutes of work on a task you're putting off"

Sometimes, it can be really hard to get started because the task we're going to do just feels overwhelmingly large or complex.
Try to break the task down to the smallest possible sub-task *(convert it into an Input Based Goal)* and give yourself 5 minutes to work on it.

>Example: if your goal is to get to the gym, promise yourself that you'll only spend 5 minutes packing your gym-bag. By the time you're done packing, the resistance to go to the gym might be gone entirely.

By the end of those 5 minutes of work, the sensation of being overwhelmed or dread that stopped you from beginning might have disappeared entirely, leaving you fully capable of working for a longer period of time, possibly even finishing the full task.

## Input Based vs. Output Based goals

- **Input Based Goal**: A goal that is based on the work itself (pack the gym bag)
- **Output Based Goal**: A goal that focuses on the end result (get a healthy body)
