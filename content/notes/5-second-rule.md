When the alarm is going off in the morning, count backwards from 5 and then just sit up. That first unwanted action that we make ourselves do, will make the next difficult (unattractive) choice easier. 
The more difficult choices we get through, the easier the next ones will be. 

If we spend time thinking about doing something for more than 5 seconds without action, 
our minds are highly likely to begin convincing us to not do it.
So instead of allowing us to contemplate, we should start the task before we find excuses to not do it.
