Overlearning is when a student repeats the study of the material more times than is necessary to perfectly repeat the content from memory, as defined by **Hermann Ebbinghaus**.

Based on later findings in the 1900s and later, it is clear that *overlearning only has any benefits for short-term memory retention*.
**For long-term retention, [Spaced repetition](notes/Spaced-repetition.md) is one of the most efficient methods available, if not the most efficient one.**
Combined with the knowledge of the [Forgetting Curve](notes/Forgetting-Curve.md), it is easy to see how [Spaced repetition](notes/Spaced-repetition.md) can be an efficient method for long-term memory retention.
