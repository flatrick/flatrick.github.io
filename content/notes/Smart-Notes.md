1.  **Writing is The Only Thing that Matters**: Thinking through the medium of writing will improve your reading, thinking, and other intellectual skills. And so this principle implies you must consume information with the purpose of writing about it.
2.  **Simplicity is Paramount**: To be successful, the system must reduce the number of decisions made by standardized note-taking, having a clear separation between the different types of notes, and designated storage for each type.
3.  **Nobody Ever Starts from Scratch**: The system must build trust by surfacing insight, connecting different lines of thought, and improving one’s thinking. As it’s used, thinking and writing should become easier and more valuable.
4.  **Let the Work Carry You Forward**: It must have a workflow that generates its own momentum through positive experiences and at the same time improve the learning process.
