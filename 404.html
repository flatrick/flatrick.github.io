Itzler completed 8. He then asked him to jump back up and do it again. This time it was 6. He asked him to jump up a third time, and Itzler squeaked out just a few. The SEAL then told him they weren’t leaving until Itzler completed 100 more. At first Itzler’s reaction was typical; there was no way he’d be able to do that, or it would take all day. But the SEAL explained to him that we are all capable of achieving more than we think we are. This was Itzler’s first introduction to the 40% Rule, a rule that this SEAL and his brothers lived by.\n\n\u003e The 40% Rule is the idea that when our mind is telling us to quit, that our body has actually only used up 40% of it’s potential. Think of this in terms of a workout; how many times have we been deep in a long grinder and that doubt begins to creep into the back of our head? Our mind begins to tell us to slow down or that it’s time to stop. According to the SEAL, at this point we are only 40% used up – and we are still capable of more. He explained that this extra 60% doesn’t come from the mind or from the body; it comes from our will.\n\nThe general idea is that the human brain is built to stop us from overusing our bodies to minimize the risk of damage and overuse of energy.\nSo when we hear that little voice in our head saying \"I can't do more\", we're not even close to our actual limits, and if we need to, we can continue pushing. The exact percentage of how much harder we really can push ourselves will vary greatly between individuals, the task being performed, the daily state of the body and mind and other variables.\n\nIn other words, don't take that 40% as an iron-clad rule, but more of a guideline.\n\n## The benefits of utilizing the rule\n- You won't limit yourself by giving up early while doing something unpleasant\n- You'll reduce overthinking in certain situations\n- You'll find that your comfort zone is quite far away from your actual limits\n- It will help you take control of yourself and get stuff done\n\n## The dangers of utilizing the rule\n- Pushing yourself to your limits is always dangerous\n  - There's a reason why our brain tries to stop us before we're even close\n- We're not machines, we need rest and self-care to be able to push ourselves hard\n  - And even then, we shouldn't be pushing ourselves that hard more than on rare occassions\n- It also takes time for our body and mind to adapt to that level of hard work\n\n# Sources\n- [Navy SEAL Has a '40 Percent Rule' And It's the Key to Overcoming Mental Barriers | Big Think](https://youtu.be/9I_u4oZqF8c)\n- [Is The Navy Seal 40% Rule Bull Shit?

By the time you're done packing, the resistance to go to the gym might be gone entirely.\n\nBy the end of those 5 minutes of work, the sensation of being overwhelmed or dread that stopped you from beginning might have disappeared entirely, leaving you fully capable of working for a longer period of time, possibly even finishing the full task.\n\n## Input Based vs. Output Based goals\n\n- **Input Based Goal**: A goal that is based on the work itself (pack the gym bag)\n- **Output Based Goal**: A goal that focuses on the end result (get a healthy body)\n\n# Sources\n- [Can’t Get Started?

If they succeed, they send the card to the next group\n  - If they fail, they send it back to the first group\n    - An alternative is to only move the card into the box in the preceeding level (i.e a box that will be review more often than the one it just came from) instead of the first box\n- Each succeeding group has a longer period of time before the learner is required to revisit the cards. \n  - In Leitner's original method, published in his book _So lernt man Lernen_ (How to learn to learn), the schedule of repetition was governed by the size of the partitions in the learning box. \n    - These were 1, 2, 5, 8 and 14cm. \n  - Only when a partition became full was the learner to review some of the cards it contained\n    - if they remembered it correctly, the card will be moved into a box for later review\n    - if they **did not** remember it correctly, the card would be moved into the box for daily reviews\n  \n## Intervals\nSo each box has a defined interval of time for when the student will review them.\nThe amount of time is not fixed, but here are some guidelines:\n\n- Box 1 is for daily reviews\n- Box 2 would be for slightly longer intervals (2 to 5 days for example) \n- Box 3 would then be for even longer intervals (6 to 14 days for example)\n \n If you use more than 3 boxes, each new box would be a larger increment of time than the previous ones.\n \n # Sources\n -
