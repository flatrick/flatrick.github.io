Itzler completed 8. He then asked him to jump back up and do it again. This time it was 6. He asked him to jump up a third time, and Itzler squeaked out just a few. The SEAL then told him they weren’t leaving until Itzler completed 100 more. At first Itzler’s reaction was typical; there was no way he’d be able to do that, or it would take all day. But the SEAL explained to him that we are all capable of achieving more than we think we are. This was Itzler’s first introduction to the 40% Rule, a rule that this SEAL and his brothers lived by.\n\n\u003e The 40% Rule is the idea that when our mind is telling us to quit, that our body has actually only used up 40% of it’s potential. Think of this in terms of a workout; how many times have we been deep in a long grinder and that doubt begins to creep into the back of our head? Our mind begins to tell us to slow down or that it’s time to stop. According to the SEAL, at this point we are only 40% used up – and we are still capable of more. He explained that this extra 60% doesn’t come from the mind or from the body; it comes from our will.\n\nThe general idea is that the human brain is built to stop us from overusing our bodies to minimize the risk of damage and overuse of energy.\nSo when we hear that little voice in our head saying \"I can't do more\", we're not even close to our actual limits, and if we need to, we can continue pushing. The exact percentage of how much harder we really can push ourselves will vary greatly between individuals, the task being performed, the daily state of the body and mind and other variables.\n\nIn other words, don't take that 40% as an iron-clad rule, but more of a guideline.\n\n## The benefits of utilizing the rule\n- You won't limit yourself by giving up early while doing something unpleasant\n- You'll reduce overthinking in certain situations\n- You'll find that your comfort zone is quite far away from your actual limits\n- It will help you take control of yourself and get stuff done\n\n## The dangers of utilizing the rule\n- Pushing yourself to your limits is always dangerous\n  - There's a reason why our brain tries to stop us before we're even close\n- We're not machines, we need rest and self-care to be able to push ourselves hard\n  - And even then, we shouldn't be pushing ourselves that hard more than on rare occassions\n- It also takes time for our body and mind to adapt to that level of hard work\n\n# Sources\n- [Navy SEAL Has a '40 Percent Rule' And It's the Key to Overcoming Mental Barriers | Big Think](https://youtu.be/9I_u4oZqF8c)\n- [Is The Navy Seal 40% Rule Bull Shit?

Writing a test that expects it to behave in a certain way\n2. Then creating an Interface that matches the input\n3. Finally creating a concrete class that follows those expectations\n\nIn the example above, I wrote a single test that checks that the method doesn't throw any exceptions when I add a book, and it was intentionally kept simple.  \nYou could write more tests for more functionality before you start writing the actual implementation, but doing it one step at a time will make it easier to handle any unexpected dependencies.\n\nAnd this is one simple way of doing [[TDD|Test Driven Development]] that should help you build functionality around how you want to work with the new function, rather than attempting to build a potentially complex model in your head before you've even written a single line of code.\n\n# Sources\n- [Wishful Thinking - C2 wiki](https://wiki.c2.com/?WishfulThinking)\n- [Programming by Wishful Thinking - DSO Guy](http://dsoguy.blogspot.com/2007/01/programming-by-wishful-thinking.html)\n- [What is Programming By Wishful Thinking? - Liam Norman](https://www.liamnorman.com/programming-by-wishful-thinking/)","lastmodified":"2022-07-18T20:07:32.350678493Z","tags":null},"/notes/SQxR":{"title":"SQxR","content":"\n_SQxR_ refers to the two acronyms [[SQxR#SQ3R]] and [[SQxR#SQ4R]] which are names of two related study methodologies.\n\n- [SQ3R](#sq3r) stands for Survey, Question, Read, Retrieve \u0026 Review\n- [SQ4R](#sq4r) stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Relate \u0026 Review\n\n---\n\n# SQ3R\n## Survey (\"S\")\nThe first step, survey or skim, advises that one should resist the temptation to read the book and instead first go through a chapter and note the headings, sub-headings and other outstanding features, such as figures, tables, and summary paragraphs. This survey step only takes 3–5 minutes, but it provides an outline or framework for what will be presented. The reader should identify ideas and formulate questions about the content of the chapter.\n\n## Question (\"Q\")\nGenerate questions about the content of the reading. For example, convert headings and sub-headings into questions, and then look for answers in the content of the text. Other more general questions may also be formulated: What is this chapter about?What question is this chapter trying to answer?How does this information help me?The Question step again only takes 3–5 minutes to complete, but it will motivate the reader to seek answers to the questions.\n\n## Read (R1)\nUse the background work done with \"S\" and \"Q\" in order to begin reading actively. This means reading in order to answer the questions raised under \"Q\". Passive reading, in contrast, results in merely reading without engaging with the study material.\n\n## Retrieve (R2)\nThe second \"R\" refers to the part known as \"Retrieve.\" The reader should try to retrieve from memory what was learned in the same manner as telling someone else about the information. It is important that the reader use his/her own words in order to formulate and conceptualize the material. Try recalling and identifying major points (heading/subheadings) and answers to questions from the \"Q\" step. This recital step may be done either in an oral or written format and is related to the benefits of retrieval (testing effect) in boosting long-term memory for the material.\n\n## Review (R3)\nThe final \"R\" is \"Review.\" Once you reach the end of the passage, say back to yourself what the point of the whole passage is – again, using your own words. You may then repeat the process on the second set of questions.[4]\n\n---\n\n# SQ4R\n\n## S Survey\nIn the first step take a couple of minutes to skim the chapter. Don't read it. Look at the chapter objectives, topic headings, picture/diagram captions, key words (if any), and read the summary. This peek at the chapter allows you to focus on the prevailing subject before getting bogged down in details. Many texts are organized often with useful coloring to assist you in this process.\n\n## Q Question\nAs you prepare to read the chapter, turn the first topic into a question or two. As you read you search for an answer to your question(s). It takes only a second to change a topic heading such as \"Correlation Studies\" into \"What is a correlation and what do the studies prove?\" This will help you organize your reading - that answers the question, that gives an example, that's just related information that may be a later question, that's how it applies to me.You may find you rephrase the question as you read more. Some early chapters are designed to create more questions which are answered in later chapters (particularly chapter 1). Most importantly, this gives you a purpose for reading the next paragraph.\n\n## R(1) Read\nLook for the answer(s) to the question(s) you posed. Read in short \"bites,\" maybe a sentence or two, then determine how that answers your question(s). Often as you read other questions will arise. A series of questions leads to a complex, college level concept that gives structure and relevance to your studies.\n\n## R(2) Recite\nNow can you answer your question(s) in your own words? Can you answer your question in the words your instructor would use (such as on a test)? If you can't, then reread the material to find the answer or to determine if you need to change the question. You are rehearsing for the time when you will need to know the answer. A good technique for rehearsing the answers is to briefly jot down the key word or words that will remind you of the essence of the answer without writing down every detail that you can never remember anyway. Some students highlight most or all of a sentence which diffuses the key word and is much less memorable than written notes. You can use the [Overlearning](notes/Overlearning.md) to improve your note taking. Quoting material is perfectively acceptable but remember to write down the bibliographical reference with it. Follow this simple rule: before you copy a quote from a source, state your purpose for copying the quote and write the meaning in your own words.\n\n## R(3) Relate\nMost of us try to relate what we are reading to what we already know unless we are in too big of a hurry to finish, in which case, we probably won't learn it anyway. It is always easier and more enjoyable to remember information that is personally meaningful. \nEverything has a context: a word in a sentence, a sentence in a paragraph, a paragraph in a concept, a concept in a topic, a topic in education, and an education in life. Some information may take some reflection time to be able to grasp relationships while other information may require more information, possibly research, to understand how it fits with other data.\n\n## R(4) Review\nOne way to minimize memory decay is to place the material you have studied firmly in your mind by reviewing it. After you finish reading the entire chapter, skim back over it and any notes you made. Now, without looking, recall the questions and answers that steered your reading. How much detail can you provide? What other questions could you (or your instructor) ask about this material? Can you provide answers to those? Can you determine how much more review you will need to master the concepts? One of the most significant steps to learning, is understanding how much you know and how well you know it. \nEffective studying requires effective reading. Rather than getting \"intellectual indigestion\" reading straight through a chapter, stop to survey, question, read, recite, relate, and review to improve reading comprehension and course grades.\n\n\n# Sources\n- [SQ3R](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R)\n- [SQ4R](https://brazosport.edu/programs/academics/Learning-Frameworks/SQ4R/index)\n\n# Related\n- [Overlearning](notes/Overlearning.md)\n- [Spaced repetition](notes/Spaced-repetition.md)\n- [Leitner system](notes/Leitner-system.md)\n- [Forgetting Curve](notes/Forgetting-Curve.md)","lastmodified":"2022-07-18T20:07:32.350678493Z","tags":null},"/notes/Smart-Notes":{"title":"Smart Notes","content":"Creator/Author: Sönke Ahrens\n\n1.  **Writing is The Only Thing that Matters**: Thinking through the medium of writing will improve your reading, thinking, and other intellectual skills. And so this principle implies you must consume information with the purpose of writing about it.\n2.  **Simplicity is Paramount**: To be successful, the system must reduce the number of decisions made by standardized note-taking, having a clear separation between the different types of notes, and designated storage for each type.\n3.  **Nobody Ever Starts from Scratch**: The system must build trust by surfacing insight, connecting different lines of thought, and improving one’s thinking. As it’s used, thinking and writing should become easier and more valuable.\n4.  **Let the Work Carry You Forward**: It must have a workflow that generates its own momentum through positive experiences and at the same time improve the learning process.\n\n# Sources\n- [Sönke Ahrens - How To Take Smart Notes](https://youtu.be/nPOI4f7yCag)\n- [How to Take Smart Notes: A Step-by-step guide](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/smart-notes)\n- [How to take smart notes](https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes)\n- [How to take Smart Notes in Obsidian](https://theknowledgeworker.substack.com/p/how-to-take-smart-notes-in-obsidian)\n# Related","lastmodified":"2022-07-18T20:07:32.350678493Z","tags":null},"/notes/Studying":{"title":"Studying","content":"\n- [Forgetting Curve](notes/Forgetting-Curve.md)\n- [Leitner system](notes/Leitner-system.md)\n- [Overlearning](notes/Overlearning.md)\n- [Spaced repetition](notes/Spaced-repetition.md)\n- [SQxR](notes/SQxR.md)","lastmodified":"2022-07-18T20:07:32.350678493Z","tags":null},"/notes/The-Three-R_s-of-Habit-Change":{"title":"The Three R's of Habit Change","content":"1.
